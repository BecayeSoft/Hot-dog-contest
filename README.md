# Nathan-s-Hot-dog-Contests
In this project, I scrape on the Nathan's Hot dog contest data from Wikipedia and tell my story behind of the competition.

**TL;DR**: Find the notebook on [Rpubs](https://rpubs.com/becaye/hot-dogs).

### Situation
Can we use graphs to explain data in an engaging way?

### Action
1. First, I scraped the data I needed from Wikipedia: [Article 1](https://medium.com/@becaye-balde/let-your-data-speak-part-1-scrapping-data-with-r-5a25fbfd4daa).
2. Then, I had to wrangle and clean that messy data:  [Article 2](https://medium.com/@becaye-balde/let-your-speak-part-2-data-preprocessing-with-r-d4715675eff8). 
3. Then, I choose the right charts and descriptions for my story: [Article 3](https://medium.com/@becaye-balde/let-your-data-speak-part-3-storytelling-with-data-a88c67b17bc8).
4. FInally, I had to edit the chart to make it more professional.

### Results
I got beautifully formatted data and used them to tell my story.
